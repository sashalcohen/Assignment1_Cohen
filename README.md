# Cannabis Licensing Timeline Analysis

The main source of my data was NY Open Data, from the Office of Cannabis Management. I got the data from this website: https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Current-OCM-Licenses/jskf-tt3q/about_data

I used this to determine a timeline of how many CAURD and non CAURD licenses were issued each month following the legalization of cannabis in New York State. The CAURD program was created to give people who were formally incarcerated for cannabis related offenses an opportunity to be the first ones to enter New York State's legal cannabis market. I wanted to understand the scope of that advantage, and whether or not it has been effective.
