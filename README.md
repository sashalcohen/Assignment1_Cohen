# Cannabis Licensing Timeline Analysis

The main source of my data was NY Open Data, from the Office of Cannabis Management. I got the data from this website: https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Current-OCM-Licenses/jskf-tt3q/about_data

I used this data to determine a timeline of how many CAURD and non CAURD licenses were issued each month following the legalization of cannabis in New York State. The CAURD program was created to give people who were formally incarcerated for cannabis related offenses an opportunity to be the first ones to enter New York State's legal cannabis market. I wanted to understand the scope of that advantage, and whether or not it has been effective. 

You could recreate this data by downloading the entire file, and pulling the CSV data from the site listed above. From there, you could go into the data notebook and replace the existing csv file with the newly downloaded file. Then, you could go into the code and update the file name of the CSV you want to import in the pd.read_csv() function. If you wanted an updated version of this analysis when the next round of the data comes out, it would be easily replicable to reflect the updated information.
